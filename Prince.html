              Hello there, this is Min ThuKha. I created this webpage to share
              my experience on coding and how I develop skills to create a
              webpage. Before I begin , I have
              something to let you guys know in advance , I don't have a degree
              for a particular field nor a certificate for web developing, I am
              just a learner like you guys. I  created this webpage to  share my experience on how I
              learned web developing and to prove that you don't need a degree or a certificate to do what you want in life, you just need skills.  No more
              description about myself and let's keep this short as much as
              possible.

      <h3><span>What</span> do you need to create a web?</h3>
      <div class="description-web">
        <p>
          To create a webpage you need a code editor and 3 essential programming
          languages . Those 3 programming languages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Don't worry, even if you
          have never heard about it before, I will give you a short description
          on it and you can learn those programming languages from the link
          below. Let's think about building a house, when we build a house the
          first thing we would do is building the structure until it looks like
          a house. When it is done, we would move onto painting the walls,
          placing furnitures and desinging the interior, only then it looks like
          a house.The same goes for creating a web, we need a structure and some
          designs to make it look like a web. In this case we use HTML for the
          structure of the web and CSS to design the structure until it looks
          like a web.<span style="color: red;font-weight:900;"> For example:</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-html">
        <p>We use HTML to build the button-</p>
      </div>
      <div class="images">
        <div><img class="button-html" src="ss.png" /></div>
        <div class="button-resulth"><img src="ss2.png" /></div>
      </div>
      <div class="text-html">
        <p>and Css to design it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="images2">
        <div><img class="css-b" src="css.png" /></div>
        <div><img class="css-r" src="cssr.png" /></div>

      <h3 id="W3">Leaning From <span style="color:seagreen;">W3Schools</span></h3>
      <div class="JS">
        <p>
          If you understand those two programming languages you can build a
          webpage but you still need to know a bit of Javascript. This is where
          I have been learning about programing languages, It is very useful and
          it will provide whatever you need to know from HTML to JavaScript.

          Trust me,You don't have to learn or memorize every single codes.The
          more you do , the more you will understand, if i have to give an advise,
          pls go through one at a time.You don't have to go through everything in it , the web itself is so specific that you might get bored after a time period  if you are not really a reader . I do have a solution for it , if you don't like to read you can learn from watching videos too. By the way the best platform to watch and learn is <span>YouTube.</span>

      <h3>Learning From <span>YouTube</span> </h3>
      <div class="youtube-ds">
        <p><span style="font-weight:900;">YouTube </span> can be very handy when you know how to use it. I first started  from YouTube , I prefer to watch and listen rather than reading and that is why I started from Youtube. If we are on the same boat try learning from Youtube. These are some example videos that you can go watch on Youtube , it may be more than an hour video but trust me they are all worth your time.</p>

        <p>"I have been learning those programing languages from both <span style="color:red;font-weight:1600;">Youtube</span> and <span style="color:green;font-weight:1900;">W3School</span> 
         . Both provide whatever I need to know to develop a webpage , so I took it as a benefit and study from both platforms. NGL personally I think <span style="color:red;font-weight:1600;">Youtube</span> is the best among , despite both being nifty. However I would take notes from W3School and jump back into Youtube to understand more about particular topic. It took me 4 months to understand what I am understanding now. I would combine my knowledge from both platforms and create something out of it. When I feel confindent about my knowledge I would go to  <span style="color:red;font-weight:1600;">Youtube</span> and watch videos on other creating websites and create along with them. Whenever I come across the code I don't understand, I would research about it and jump back into creating . This method really helps if you understand the basics of programing languages , however good things take time don't rush you might miss the principal rules. GoodLuck with your Journey on learning how to create a website , I wish you the best."</p>
